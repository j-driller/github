These are a sampling of talks given by me at the 'WWW Word' to Web Developers and
Content  Authors at EBMUD. The audience was junior or non-technical. The talks were given
monthly, for several years, while I managed  the organization's internal and external web presence.
The group consisted of 70+ members and, as time went on, transitioned to other members contributing
as well.

Note these are primarily Powerpoints that were ticklers for the talk; what was said was more
detailed, but followed these page's points. Remember, things move fast in the Web World, much
of this is only historically relevant.

Feel free to glean and use as you wish. I hope it is as useful to your organization as it was to
ours.
